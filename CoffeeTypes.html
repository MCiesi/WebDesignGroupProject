<h2> Different Types of Coffee</h2>
        <p> Here, we explore some of the most popular types of coffee you can enjoy at coffee trucks across our Dublin.</p>

        <h3>1. Espresso</h3>
        <p>Espresso is a strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. The name comes from the Italian word for "pressed out". It's the base for almost all coffee drinks.</p>

        <h3>2. Americano</h3>
        <p>An Americano consists of espresso diluted with hot water, reducing the intensity of the coffee's taste without mixing in other additives.</p>

        <h3>3. Cappuccino</h3>
        <p>Cappuccino consists of a third of espresso, a third of steamed milk, and a third of foamed milk, resulting in a rich, creamy texture. Many people and coffee shops add powdered chocolate on top to provide some additonal sweetness. </p>

        <h3>4. Latte Macchiato</h3>
        <p>A Latte Macchiato is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a small amount of foamed milk. It's smooth and milky, perfect for those who prefer a milder coffee.</p>

        <h3>6. Mocha</h3>
        <p>A Mocha combines espresso with steamed milk and chocolate syrup, often topped with whipped cream. A mocha is a favourite for chocolate lovers!</p>

        <h3>7. Flat White</h3>
        <p>A Flat White is made by pouring equal parts steamed milk and espresso, giving it a strong coffee flavor while maintaining a creamy texture.</p>

        <h3>8. Irish Coffee</h3>
        <p>A bit of a wildcard, Irish Coffee features whiskey mixed with espresso and sugar, and topped with cream instead of milk. Definitely not the drink to start your day with, but one that offers a very unique taste.</p>
