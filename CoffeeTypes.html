<h2> Different Types of Coffee</h2>
        <p> Here, we explore some of the most popular types of coffee you can enjoy at coffee trucks across our Dublin.</p>

        <h3>1. Espresso</h3>
        <p>Espresso is a strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. The name comes from the Italian word for "pressed out". It's the base for almost all coffee drinks.</p>

        <h3>2. Americano</h3>
        <p>An Americano consists of espresso diluted with hot water, reducing the intensity of the coffee's taste without mixing in other additives.</p>

        <h3>3. Cappuccino</h3>
        <p>Cappuccino consists of a third of espresso, a third of steamed milk, and a third of foamed milk, resulting in a rich, creamy texture. Many people and coffee shops add powdered chocolate on top to provide some additonal sweetness. </p>

        <h3>4. Latte Macchiato</h3>
        <p>A Latte Macchiato, or simply Latte, is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a small amount of foamed milk. It's smooth and milky, perfect for those who prefer a milder coffee.</p>

        <h3>5. Mocha</h3>
        <p>A Mocha combines espresso with steamed milk and chocolate, often topped with whipped cream. This drink is a favourite among many chocolate lovers!</p>

        <h3>6. Flat White</h3>
        <p>A Flat White is made by pouring equal parts steamed milk and espresso, giving it a strong coffee flavor while maintaining a creamy texture.</p>

        <h3>Bonus: Irish Coffee</h3>
        <p>A bit of a wildcard, as you're more likely to find it in a bar than any coffee shop, Irish Coffee features whiskey mixed with espresso and sugar, and topped with cream instead of milk. Definitely not the drink to start your day with, but one that offers a very unique taste.</p>
