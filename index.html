<h3>So what is coffee?</h3>
<p align="justify">It may seem like a silly question, everyone knows what coffee is, right? You take some ground-up roasted coffee beans, filter some hot water through them, maybe mix with some milk and sugar, and you get coffee. But did you know that coffee has been around since at least the <b>15<sup>th</sup> century</b>? It originated in Ethiopia, quickly spreading across the Middle East and soon further across the world thanks to its caffeine content's stimulative effects. Coffeehouses became important places of social gathering and exchange of ideas, often indirectly leading to major innovations in arts and science. As time went on, different cultures of coffee consumption emerged, and with them a plethora of different types of coffee. But no matter if you like it sweet, bitter, with milk or without, <em>we can all agree that coffee is one of the best culinary inventions humans came up with</em>! </p>
